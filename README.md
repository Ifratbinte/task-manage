### This is a [Task Management Dashboard](https://github.com/Ifratbinte/task-manage) project.

Here I utilized technologies as Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, RTK, Redux-persist.

#### The primary functionalities include : 

- Add new task with required field & client-side form validation.
- Display created task in a table.
- Task details update.
- Allowed user to mark task as complete. It maintained with a checkbox.
- Delete task individually
- Implemented filters task with active, completed and all options

The project employs Redux-persist for browser localStorage & Redux Toolkit for state management, enhancing the scalability and maintainability of the application.
